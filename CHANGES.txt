0.0.1 - 10/03/2013
    * Initial release.
    * Basic working prototype. Demonstrates idea, probably shouldn't be used.

0.0.2 - 12/03/2013 
    * Starting to tighten up on the internals.
    * Change API to allow more flexibility in configuration.
    * More testing. 

0.0.3 - 13/03/2013
    * Improved a few internals.
    * Opened up creating generators from instances as a general API.
    * Test integration.

0.0.4 - 13/03/2013 
    * No changes except that I checked in a failing test case for 0.0.3
      so had to replace the release. Doh

0.0.5 - 13/03/2013
    * No changes except trying to fix packaging

0.1.0 - 23/03/2013
    * Introduce stateful testing.
    * Massive rewrite of internals to add flags and strategies.

0.1.1 - 24/03/2013 
    * Python 3.x support via 2to3.
    * Use new style classes (oops). 


0.1.2 - 24/03/2013
    * Bugfix: Stateful testing was not minimizing correctly and could
      throw exceptions.
    * Better support for recursive strategies.
    * Support for named tuples.
    * Much faster integer generation.

0.1.3 - 03/05/2013
    * Bugfix: Stateful testing behaved incorrectly with subclassing.
    * Complex number support
    * support for recursive strategies
    * different error for hypotheses with unsatisfiable assumptions

0.1.4 - 14/12/2013 fu
    * Make verification runs time bounded with a configurable timeout

0.2.0 - 07/01/2015
    * It's aliiive.
    * Improve python 3 support using six.
    * Distinguish between byte and unicode types.
    * Fix issues where FloatStrategy could raise.
    * Allow stateful testing to request constructor args.
    * Fix for issue where test annotations would timeout based on when the 
      module was loaded instead of when the test started

0.2.1 - 07/01/2015
    * Fix a bug in the new stateful testing feature where you could make
      __init__ a @requires method. Simplification would not always work if the
      prune method was able to successfully shrink the test.

0.2.2 - 08/01/2015
    * Fix an embarassing complete failure of the installer caused by my being
      bad at version control
